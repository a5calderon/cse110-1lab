## Short Bio
Hi! My name is Andrea Calderon. I am a 3rd year CS student. I'm super excited to be in CSE110.

## Hobbies
**Vinyl record collecting**\
I was gifted a turntable for Christmas. Since then, I've been ~~participating in an expensive hobby~~ collecting vinyls.Images:

**Gaming on Nintendo 3ds**\
My current game rotation includes Animal Crossing New Leaf, Build a Bear, and Super Mario.

**Coffee crafting**\
I got into coffee last year because of my job (what's my job?? Skip to relevant [section](#my-ucsd-experience) ). Currently, my top favorite drinks are:
- hazelnut shaken espresso
- iced dirty chai
- caramel frappe

**Reading**\
I'm currently reading _Little Women_. Here is a quote: 
>"I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship."

## My UCSD Experience

**My favorite classes:**
1. CSE100
2. CSE167 ([test copy 4.png](https://github.com/a5calderon/cse110-1lab/blob/main/test%20copy%204.png?raw=true))
3. CSE8A, where ``` print("Hello World")``` was exciting

**Jobs**\
I used to work at 64 degrees; however, now I work at Starbucks.

**Summer plans**\
I will be in a lab this summer, through a program called STARS. This is their [homepage](https://grad.ucsd.edu/oar2/oar2office/programs/undergraduate-programs/stars/index.html).
